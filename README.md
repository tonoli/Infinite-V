# Infinite-V
### This project allows you visualize the infinity! Sounds cool?

With this project I worked on the mathematical coplexity and awsomness of fractals. 
The program offers the possibility to represent several known fractals. I have also created an UI interface to be able to play arround change colors, deepth and move arround with the keyboard or the mouse!
